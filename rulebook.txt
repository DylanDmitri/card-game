DESIGN GOALS

Force Improvisation
    Variety. 
    Break the default gameplan. Hard choices, sharp contrasts.
    Randomness builds stories (Hearthstone)

Prefer emergent mechanics
    Building blocks.
    Don't make explicity opportunity attack rules...
    make these rules emerge from the initiative system
    
When in doubt, Simplify
    rule of outliers: one interesting thing is better than ten mediocre ones
    tighten the gameplay loop

----------------------------

Characters are
    - a deck of cards, built from some number of tracks
    - a luck counter

Luck resets per scene.
It is a PvE mechanic, essentially the number of permissable failures.

----------------------------

Cards have
    perception and stubborness
        when asked to use these
        choose a card from your hand
        if it is not already revealed, reveal it 
            (show to opponent, and keep visible afterwards)
        use that card's stat as your stat
        You may choose not to reveal any card, in which case your defense is 0.

    a list of effects, each with
        tags describing where it can be used
            kinds: [action] [modifier] [discard]
            priority: [slow] [regular] [fast]
            targets: range, aoe, number, etc
            other: combo
        
        these tags are usually given in shorthand
        	for example, [melee attack] means
        		kind: action
        		priority: regular
        		target: single adjacent enemy	

        a textual description of the effect or effects
        usually common effects are given in shorthand
        	for example, [walk 5] means
        		kind: action
        		priority: slow
        		target: self
        		effect: give +5 move


Combat flow
Round
    All players draw cards equal to their [draw]. 
    	This is usually the number of tracks they have.
        Draw until deck is empty, then reshuffle discard pile for a new deck.

    Teams alternate.
        Choose a team member to either play an action or discard a card.
            This is mandatory if any team member has more cards in hand than their [hold].
            If both teams pass here, proceed to the next round.
        
        The game enters "sequence" mode.
            Each character may play only one card per sequence 
            	exception: "discard" effects, which specify their own criteria
            	exception: cards with "combo"
            Create an action stack for this sequence.
            The stack has levels. Each level has
                - one action
                - zero to many modifiers

        To play an action
        	Choose valid targets for the action.
        		If you cannot do so, you cannot play the action.
        		These targets are locked in, and may not change.
        	Add the action to the top of the stack
        
        When an action becomes the top of the stack
            Any participant may choose to play a new action.
                The new action must have higher priority.
                If multiple participants want to add an action
                    the participant with highest perception wins
                    if tied, the active team wins
                That new action becomes top of the stack

            All participants may choose to apply a modifier to the current action.
                The modifier must be of equal or higher priority.
                Once applied, a modifier cannot be taken back.
                When no one wants to add a modifier, proceed.

            The current action resolves, with all applied modifiers.
            The stack drops down. The next action becomes the top of the stack.
            
            If the stack is empty, it clears. Swap active teams and repeat.


In combat / out of combat interactions
    Each turn lasts six seconds, and each characters draws <3> cards.
    Each character can hold one card between rounds.
    Outside of combat the same rules apply.

    If characters have 30 seconds to prep, they can cycle through all their cards.
    This means characters can be holding 1 card of their choice at the start of combat.
    In case of ambushes, the surprised side doesn't have this extra card.

    Instant obstacles, for example when a pit trab suddenly opens
        Player [draws] and then calculates their defense normally
    Passive obstacles, for example a door that can be broken down
        You may spend 30 seconds, then use whatever hand you want

Attack effects
	interrupt : target cannot affect the current sequence. (cancel cards, no new cards)
	stagger x : interrupt, then defender discards x cards (attacker chooses which ones)
	prone     : interrupt, defender discards all cards. Next turn they only draw half.
	lethal x  : deal some amount of damage, by default 1

	walk X	  : move X at slow speed
	run X     : move X at regular speed
	combo     : may be played even if you have already played in this sequence
	jump      : this movement ignores terrain effects	


spending move
	when a character is granted  move points
	immediately, that character may spend some or all of it
		1 move to travel 1 square
		different amounts for obstacles and terrain interactions
	unspent move points are lost

====================================
==== Rules Examples


A Cleric attempts to move away from two goblins.
The Goblins are both holding a copy of "slash".

Start of sequence, stack is clear

	Cleric casts "walk 2" which is really "slow action : grant yourself 2 move"
		action has a valid target
		"walk 2" becomes top of the stack
		any character may choose to activate a [regular] or [fast] action
		Krug chooses to do so

	Krug activates "slash"
		action has a valid target (the cleric has not yet moved)
		"slash" becomes top of stack, any character may use a [fast] action 
			- all pass
		any character may apply a modifer
		the Cleric's buddy applies a "covering fire", granting +2 interfere
		    - all pass
		the action resolves
		cleric rolls (d6 + 2) and goblin rolls (d6 + 0)
		the cleric randomly wins, and so is unharmed
		the stack drops down

	"walk 2" becomes the top of the stack
		any character may choose to activate a [regular] or [fast] action
		Grug chooses to do so
		:: note :: if Krug had another slash in hand, he couldn't play it
		:: note :: all characters are limited to one card per stack 

	Grug activates "slash"
		action has a valid target (the cleric has not yet moved)
		"slash" becomes top of stack
		any character may choose to activate a [fast] action 
			- all pass
		any character may choose to apply a modifer
		    - all pass
		the action resolves
		cleric rolls (d6 + 0) and goblin rolls (d6 + 1)
		the goblin wins, and so the attack deals one damage
		the cleric uses their armor to prevent the damage
			"discard - reducing incoming damage by 1"
		the stack drops down

	"walk 2" becomes the top of the stack
		any character may choose to activate a [regular] or [fast] action
			- all pass
		any character may choose to apply a modifier
			:: note :: slows and move buffs could be applied here
			- all pass
		the action resolves
		the cleric gains 2 move
		the cleric spents the 2 move to travel 2 squares
		the stack drops down

	stack is empty, the sequence ends
	active team flips from the cleric to the goblins.

In high level terms
	The cleric starts to move.
	Fist goblin opportunity attacks.
		Ranger uses "covering fire"
		Goblin misses.
	Second goblin opportunity attacks
		Goblin hits.
		Cleric discards an armor to protect.
	The Cleric continues their move.



Example two

Two thugs, one with power attack and one with stunning blow.
A civilian with "dash" who needs to get away.

civilian is active
	They use dash.
	The thugs don't have any fast actions, and can't respond.
	Civilian moves to safety.

thugs are active
	Thug A uses power attack.
	Characters with normal actions may respond
		civilian, do you wish to respond? No.
		thug B, do you wish to respond? No.
	Splat

	Thug A uses power attack.
	Characters with normal actions may respond
		civilian, do you wish to respond? No.
		thug B, do you wish to respond? Yes, with stunning blow at the civilian.
		civilian, do you wish to respond? No.
	Splat

	Thug A uses power attack.
	Characters with normal actions may respond.
		civilian, do you wish to respond? Yes, with dash targetting myself.
		thug team, do you wish to respond? Yes, thug B plays stunning blow at the civilian.
		civilian team cannot respond, all members have played
		thug team cannot respond, all memebers have played

	## compare priority. If tied, thugs win because they are the active team.

	If thugs win priority,
		resolve the stunning blow. If it hits,
			interrupt the civilian, cancelling the dash.
			Splat.
	If civlian wins priority,
		resolve the dash. The civilian moves far away.
		stunning blows resolves, but has no effect since target is out of reach.


Realistic Scenarios

	Civlian has initiative.
		- escape immediately, no reaction possible.

	Thugs have initiative, civilian has perception
		Thug B attempts stunning blow.
		If it hits, and if dash is discarded, Thug A kills.
		- depends on the stunning blow roll, and dash discard.

	Thugs have initiative, thugs have perception
		Thug A launches power attack.
		Thug B follows up with stunning blow.
		If stunning blow hits, it locks out all actions from the interrupt.
		- depends on the stunning blow roll.



A : thugs has initiative?	   50%
B : thugs has perception?	   80%  given that they have initiative
C : does stunning blow hit?    70%  at +1
D : does dash get discarded?   50%  one out of two cards


Stunning blow +1 stagger 1

A and C and (B or D)

50% and 83% and (80% or 50%)


Assuming you both have a 30% chance of a perception card.
There's a 80% chance you have perception given initiative


58/72/83  and (80 or 0/50/100)

	     	+0    +1    +2
interrupt   46    52	58
stagger 1 	58    65    72
stagger 2	66    75    83




58/72/83  and (80 or 0/50/100)

	     	+0    +1    +2
interrupt       52	58
stagger 1 	58    65    72
stagger 2	66    75    83

Assuming they have better perception cards, so they win 50%
