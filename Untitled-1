what does distract apply to?
    can you distract someone attacking you?
    attacking an ally?
    does it only work against defense?

how does passing work?
    sometimes you want to remain hidden
    you can discard a card with no effect

slow moves are interesting add more of them

goblin track is good on archer, bad on melee dude
    make something more balanced

snipe should go up to +2, make it feel deadly


+2 vs +4 = 30% chance goblins win
