GNOMES IN SPACE


The "mech shell" is your base class.
Determines which modules you can comfortably equip.

Players will have a big piece of paper, with mech shell info.
Also general game info.

They will also have a deck.


Mech Shell

	5 cards
		they can do different stuff!

	cpu and hull
		class cards contain the biggest bonuses
		maybe each mech has a baseline as well

	heat capacity + cooling rate
		determines how powerful of modules you can equip
		you take damage if you overheat

	some number of module slots
		each module adds 5 slots
		can make different types of modules
			ie "weapon" vs "utility" vs "armor"

	baseline mech options
		default movement
		default attack


Damage and Overheating

	You have two tracks, [heat] and [structure damage]. Both start at 0.

	Attacks usually deal one of the following

	interrupt 	: cancel cards currently on stack. 
	knockback X : interrupt, then slide backwards X squares. If you hit an obstacle, convert remaining knockback to stagger.
	stagger X 	: interrupt, then discard X cards. If you can't discard, convert remaining stagger to structure damage.
	
	X thermal damage : add X to your heat track
	X structure damage : for each point of damage,

		increment your [structure damage] track
		roll a d6 for each [structure damage] you you. Take the lowest roll:
			5-6 : Just the armor! No effect 
			2-4 : Destroy random module. (keep cards, just they have no effect)
			1   : Mech destroyed.

		Broken modules can be repaired in combat, but structural damage can't.


Overheating

	Stronger cards can be balanced by higher heat costs.
	Some cards can might have optional heat costs, or a spent 1 heat per

	If heat hits the maximum, something bad happens
	maybe
		after your current heat changes, 
		if it's greater than your max, 
		take one point of structural damage.

	Each round, when you draw new cards, your mech cools by its [cooling rate]

Chassis Specific Actions

	Discard any card to
		walk 1
		punch

	Discard any three cards to
		fully vent, clearing all heat

Protocols

	passive bonuses, flavored as AI
	each mech can have only one active 








Everest (Tier II - general purpose)
	"A plainly designed and cost-effective chassis."

	1 primary weapon
	1 hardpoint

	heat capacity 5, cooling 1
	
	Passive - Simple Lines
		Tier 2 mechs typically draw 2 cards per round. Instead,
		At the start of each round, draw three cards and choose one to discard.

	Actives - Functional Grace
		Play any card to `move 3`
		Play any card to `punch: +0 vs Hull, stagger 1 or knockback 1`
		Full round action to `reboot: discard all attatched programs`

	Passive - Sturdy Bulk
		If you are at 1 [structure damage], add 2 to your damage save.


Drake (Tier III - defensive)
	"A heavily armored shell, built around a single-cast bulkhead."

	1 primary weapon
	1 hardpoint

	heat capacity 7, cooling 0

	Large size (2x2 grid)
	+1 hull (stacking)
	
	Passive
		

	Actives
		Play any card to `move 3`
