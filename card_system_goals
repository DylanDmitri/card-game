problem statement
goals

character building is rich
character piloting is poor

player loop
    wait for turn -> auto attack -> wait for turn

encounter loop
    burn resources per encounter
    good strategy gets you through with less waste


force creativity by providing options
    "an opportunity comes up to do x"
    force creativity through option availibility
        block options conditionally
        have a deck and draw cards
        have an "this option comes up" action


-----------------------------

DESIGN GOALS

Force Improvisation
    Variety. 
    Break the default gameplan. These enemies are armored. What do you do?
    Randomness builds stories (Hearthstone)

Provide Building Blocks
    Give tools not fish.
    Don't give immunity to opportunity attacks....
    give additional movement and acrobatics so you can jump off the wall.
    
When in doubt, Simplify
    rule of outliers: one good thing is better than two mediocre ones
    tighten the gameplay loop

-------------

Physical, Mental, Luck

Physical and Mental are primary power limiters.
Luck is a scene-based expendable resource, number of permissable failures.
