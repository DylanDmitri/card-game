A team can typically take out something one tier higher.
With a two-tier discrepency, the situation is probably hopeless.

Extra damage for tier advantage ??
	additional knockback and stagger ??


Attack Types

	shrapnel X
		deals X kinetic damage and X knockback
		hull substracts first from kinetic, and second from knockback
		
	kinetic damage
		usually: [+accuracy] vs [evasion]
		deals structure damage directly

	thermal damage
		fills up target's heat capacity
		when it's full, causes structure damage by overheating

	knockback
		incoming knockback is passively reduced by hull
		if crashes into a wall, convert remaining knockback to concussive damage

	concussive damage
		usually: [+explosives] vs [hull]
		target discards cards randomly
		if their hand is empty, convert to structure damage


Define more tags. Use these for rich interactions.


Stats

	agility
		movement speed
		priority
		evasion

	hull
		toughness
		strength
		resilience

	cpu
		magic / hacking

	systems and heat



Only one card per unit per stack.

One team chooses a member to play a standard or slow action.
Every character may play one card on top of that.
Cards resolve from the fastest mech to the slowest.

The base mech-frame is foliot tier
Higher-tier mech are simply the base mech frame, with upgrades applied on top.
Every three upgrades increases the tier by one.
