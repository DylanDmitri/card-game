----------------------------

Characters are
    - a deck of cards, built from some number of tracks
    - a luck counter

Luck resets per scene.
It is essentially the number of permissable failures.

----------------------------

Cards have
    speed, perception, and stubborness
        Discard any card to move [speed] squares as an [action].

        When asked to use these as defenses
        Choose a card from your hand
        If it is not already revealed, reveal it 
            (show to opponent, and keep visible afterwards)
        Use that card's stat as your defense
        You may choose not to reveal any card, in which case your defense is 0

    a list of effects, each with
        tags describing where it can be used
            priority: [slow] [default] [fast] [ultra fast]
            kinds: [action] [modifier] [reaction]

        general tags: [attack] [distraction] ...

        a textual description of the effect

        you may play the card to activate one of the chosen effects


Combat flow
Round
    All players draw cards equal to their [draw]. This is usually the number of tracks they have.
        Draw until deck is empty, then reshuffle discard pile for a new deck.

    Teams alternate.
        Choose a team member to take an action.
            This is mandatory if any team member has more cards in hand than their [hold].
            If both teams pass here, proceed to the next round.
        
        The game enters "stack" mode. 
            Each character may play only one card per stack.
            The stack has levels. Each level has
                - one action
                - zero to many modifiers
        
        When an action becomes the top of the stack
            Any participant may choose to add a new action to the stack.
                The new action must have higher priority.
                If multiple participants want to add an action
                    the participant with highest perception wins
                    if tied, the active team wins
                That new action becomes top of the stack

            All participants may choose to apply a modifier to the current action.
                The modifier must be of equal or higher priority.
                Once applied, a modifier cannot be taken back.
                When no one wants to add a modifier, proceed.

            The current action resolves, with all applied modifiers.
            The stack drops down. The next highest-priority action becomes the top.
            
            If the stack is empty, it clears. Swap active teams and repeat.

In combat / out of combat interactions
    Each turn lasts six seconds, and each characters draws <3> cards.
    Each character can hold one card between rounds.
    Outside of combat the same rules apply.

    If characters have 30 seconds to prep, they can cycle through all their cards.
    This means characters can be holding 1 card of their choice at the start of combat.
    In case of ambushes, the surprised side doesn't have this extra card.

    Instant obstacles, for example when a pit trab suddenly opens
        Player [draws] and then calculates their defense normally
    Passive obstacles, for example a door that can be broken down
        You may spend 30 seconds, then use whatever hand you want

perception / stubborness

    +1  25%  A subtle or flavorful buff. 
    +2  10%  Interesting, a key consideration of this card.
    +3   5%  This card is exclusively for this bonus.

speed
    The others grant the bonuses passively, but speed is in contrast to the card's effect.
    Either you get the speed or the effect.
    This means effect strength and speed should be positively correlated.
